# Source Control Management (SCM) and GitHub

## What is Source Control Management (SCM)?
Source Control Management (SCM) is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to software code. It allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously, keeping a history of modifications and enabling collaboration without conflicts. SCM helps in:
- Version tracking
- Collaboration
- Backup and recovery
- Code branching and merging
- Managing releases and deployments

## How GitHub Helps with SCM
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides Git repository hosting and SCM tools, making it easier to manage software projects. Key benefits of using GitHub for SCM include:
- Repository Hosting: Store and manage Git repositories securely.
- Collaboration: Enables teams to work together through pull requests, code reviews, and discussions.
- Branching & Merging: Facilitates feature development without affecting the main codebase.
- Version Control: Keeps a history of changes, allowing rollbacks if necessary.
- CI/CD Integration: Automates testing and deployment processes.
- Issue Tracking: Helps manage bugs, enhancements, and project workflows.
- Security & Access Control: Allows role-based access and security scanning of repositories.
